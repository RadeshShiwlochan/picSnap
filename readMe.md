This app is for demonstration how to allow a user to upload pictures. Also it shows how to use css for styling the app and learning how to use partial views in Express with ejs.
This project uses:
	• Express.js
	• Node.js
	• ejs
	• css

Future Plans:

I still have not figured out how to add the feature to upload pics as this project is a work in progress.
