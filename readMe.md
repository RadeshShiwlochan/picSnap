This app is for demonstration how to allow a user to upload pictures and store the pictures in a mongoDB database. It has a login page on the home page (just for show, doesnt really do anything) which takes a person to their profile.  Also it shows how to use css for styling the app and learning how to use partial views in Express with ejs.
This project uses:

	• Express.js
	• Node.js
	• MongoDB
	• ejs
	• css
	• Mutler.js

Multer was used to upload files, namely pictures, to a folder that was specified in the route. The picture is then rendered to the view in the ordinary way of using html to portray the image.
